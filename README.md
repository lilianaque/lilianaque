✨ Hi! My name is Lily! Welcome to my Github!

🌷 As you can see, I haven't exactly been active on Github as I haven't been working on personal projects.
However, I'm very passionate about how computer science is taught and how it can be improved- especially for new learners. I remember taking my very first Python class in college expecting to learn everything from scratch, only to be met with a very fast-paced class with a mean professor and classmates who seemed to already have a strong background in Python. Needless to say, I stopped my computer science classes after to that to take a step back and try to understand if I really could attain a future in tech. I gave up so many times because of the lack of support and self-determination, but in my junior year, I decided I wanted this. I loved the creativity in coding and the excitement I felt in my bones when a program I wrote worked! 

💻 But clearly, there's a problem with how coding is being taught so I'm making it my goal to test numerous resources and see what teaches coding, specifically coding, the best!
Here are some of the resources I'll be testing:
- Codecademy
- Codedex
- FreeCodeCamp
- Programming with Mosh

👩🏻‍💻 What are some of my technical interests?
- Artificial Intelligence
- Natural Language Processing
- Technology and Speech Development

📝 What are my Learning Goals for 2024?
- Build up my Github! and Learn how to use Github to its fullest potential
- Refreshing my knowledge in coding Data Structures and Algorithms
- Refreshing my knowledge in MongoDB
- Building something with Front-End code
- Looking up some fun NLP projects I can code
- Looking up some fun AI projects I can code
- Overall, becoming PROFICIENT in Python

I am so excited to start my journey while also wrapping up my last semester of university!
